# IPL Data Analysis and Predictive Visualizations

## Project Overview
This project analyzes IPL match data and explores trends, insights, and predictions through a series of visualizations. It includes descriptive analytics, predictive modeling, and advanced statistical techniques to better understand factors influencing match outcomes.

## Features
1. **Descriptive Analysis**
   - Initial cleaning and preprocessing of the IPL dataset.
   - Exploratory visualizations to understand match statistics.
   - Insights into team performances, player awards, toss outcomes, and win margins.

2. **Predictive Visualizations**
   - **Regression Analysis**: Predicting total runs, result margins, and winning probabilities.
   - **Clustering**: Grouping teams based on performance metrics.
   - **Time Series Analysis**: Forecasting match counts over seasons.
   - **Feature Importance**: Identifying key factors in match outcomes using machine learning.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following software and R packages installed:

### Software
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- RStudio (optional but recommended)

### R Libraries
- `readr`  
- `ggplot2`  
- `dplyr`  
- `tidyr`  
- `forecast`  
- `cluster`  
- `nnet`  
- `mgcv`  
- `randomForest`  

You can install missing libraries using:
```r
install.packages(c("readr", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "forecast", "cluster", "nnet", "mgcv", "randomForest"))
```

## File Structure
```
├── IPL.csv                  # Dataset used for analysis
├── analysis.R               # R script with data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations
├── README.md                # Documentation file (this file)
```

## Usage
1. **Load the Dataset**  
   Ensure the `IPL.csv` file is available in the working directory. Update the file path in the script if needed.

2. **Run the R Script**  
   Open the `analysis.R` file in RStudio or your R environment and execute it step-by-step to explore the data and visualizations.

3. **Explore the Visualizations**  
   The script generates a variety of plots, from descriptive insights to predictive models, including:
   - Scatter plots with regression lines.
   - Heatmaps for residuals.
   - Cluster plots for team grouping.
   - Ribbon plots for run trends.
